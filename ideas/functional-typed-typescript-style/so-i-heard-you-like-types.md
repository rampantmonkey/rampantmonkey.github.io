One style of typescript that I have found useful on some projects.

It is counter to the normal class based or javascript+type annotations approaches I most often encounter.
The goal is to maximize the benefit we get from investing in types.
Not just some documentation. Actual compilation errors that prevent real bugs.
Some bonus ergonomics when dealing with errors as well (unwrap anyone!) (inspired by rust).

Explain the style, show the examples with both Koa error handling middleware and the parser combinator.

For the parser combinator write a simple lisp. (A frontend to my mukjs interpreter?).

This is going to be a long one...
