# Ergodox Pedestal

I have been trying to minimize the desk space for my keyboard. I just want to sit in front of the monitor. If the task I'm doing requires a ton of desk space, that is a different workspace. This one is just about focused programming and game playing.

Iteration 0: repurposed folding table found in our laundry room originally purchased from target 10 years ago.
Iteration 1: $10 of wood (yes. even with inflated prices of building supplies in 2022 the goal was still to keep it cheap) and 10 minutes of effort with whatever tools happened to be charged. It is not even close to level. I didn't bother sanding it, let alone putting a real finish on it. Gets the point across and unblocks me. Now I can use my workspace even if it is ugly.
