<p>Yesterday I stumbled across a project on twitter that fascinated me so I figured that I would share it here.
<a href="http://handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a> is a quest to build a video game from scratch completely live streamed.
Building from scratch is how I like to do everything, especially learning.</p>

<p>Handmade Hero <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/handmade_hero">streams live</a> every weekday at 8PM PST<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and has an archive of all previous sessions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive">youtube</a>. Don&#39;t worry, the project started on 17 Nov 2014 so there are only a handful of episodes currently in the backlog.</p>

<p>Go watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2dxjOjWHxQ">trailer</a> and preorder the game for full access to the source code.</p>
