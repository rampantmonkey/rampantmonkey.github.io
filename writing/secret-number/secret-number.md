Game from Episode 5 of The Devil's Plan on Netflix.

# Rules

Transcribed from subtitles:

In Secret Number, players make contact with other players to guess their own unique number.

Before the game begins, players will enter the dealer room one by one and draw one card from a set of 100 that are marked from 1 to 100.

Their card will determine their number.

What number a player draws will not be revealed to anyone, including the player themselves.

Once the game begins, players may gain clues about their number by making contact with other players.

Players may make contact in the two contact rooms in the game area.

Two players who wish to make contact must each submit one ticket.

There are a total of four tickets, including addition, multiplication, division, and zero tickets.

Players obtain different types of information based on the ticket type.

The addition ticket reveals the sum of the two numbers.

If the sum is larger than 180, it will be displayed as a range from 180 to 199.

If the sum is less than 20, it will be displayed as a range from 3 to 20.

The multiplication ticket reveals the last digit of the product of the two numbers.

The division ticket reveals the quotient of the larger number divided by the smaller number.

The remainder will be omitted.

The zero ticket reveals the total number of zeroes between the two numbers (0(6, 40) = 3).

Once the game begins, each player will receive one set of the four tickets.

During the game, players may purchase one set of tickets with one Piece.

When the game ends players must guess their numbers and submit an answer sheet.

If a player guesses their number correctly, they gain five points.


# My Focus
I'm going to focus on the information sharing portion of the game. The social aspects and piece economy are outside the scope.

In particular I want to understand two of the strategies presented in the show.

1. What is the probability that two players working together can determine both of their numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 tickets? Zero. They will never know who has which number. Better question: what is the probability that they can determine the two numbers.
2. What pairs of numbers require the lest tickets and which ones require the most?
3. Which tickets reveal the most information? Which ones the least? Does this ranking change if you play a pair of tickets?
4. How many tickets are needed for three players to all learn their numbers? Obviously one more ticket (the addition) can reveal the third player's number after the first two players know theirs. But is that always the case? Particularly with the range game.
