:description Cross country adventure with my family.
:date 2024-05-04

After our failed pregnancy last fall I have wanted to go on a road trip.
Nowhere in particular.
I just needed to go.
Take the people I love and explore.
Anywhere other than here.

We did it. 
We spent 18 days driving across the country and back.
6,759.8 miles through 23 states.
