[^1]: Absurdist twist on the typical stagecoach robbery story with my favorite Taskmaster contestants.
[^2]: Only movie I have watched twice since having kids. Well, movie that I chose to watch twice.
[^3]: You know what you are signing up for just reading the cast list.
[^4]: Genuine interest in new locations with self deprecating humor.
[^5]: Similar plot to Long Way Round with more difficult countries to navigate. Being a sequel took away some of the uncertainty.
[^6]: Well made show. For someone else. Too heartfelt and sincere for me.
[^7]: Too many things handed to the team and too much emphasis on the prototype electric motorcycles. Inspiring me to put Bolivia at the top of my travel wishlist is the only reason this is not in F-tier.
