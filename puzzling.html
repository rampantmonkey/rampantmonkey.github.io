      <p>One of my recent hobbies has been creating puzzles and organizing hunts. I particularly enjoy designing unique input/output mechanisms for puzzle events.</p>

      <p>Most of my puzzle writing experience has been as a part of organizing <a href="https://dcphr.org">DCPH<sup>&reg;</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>DCPH<sup>&reg;</sup> 1 was my first time participating in the creation of a puzzle hunt. I coauthored <a href="https://dcphr.org/2016/puzzles/shelob.html">Shelob</a>, <a href="https://dcphr.org/2016/puzzles/minotaur.html">Minotaur</a>, and <a href="https://dcphr.org/2016/puzzles/cyclops.html">Cyclops</a>. I also <a href="/writing/lycanthropic_love/">implemented</a> Lycanthropic Love - the webapp for the <a href="https://dcphr.org/2016/puzzles/werewolf.html">Werewolf</a> puzzle.</p>

      <p>For DCPH<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 I focused on organizing the hunt and building various input/output devices. I coauthored a <a href="https://dcphr.org/2017/static/players_book.pdf">choose your own adventure book</a> which served as the primary input/output device for the hunt. I also built a book with an embedded circuit which allowed players to navigate a virtual word-ladder for the Gates of Time puzzle.</p>

      <p>In DCPH<sup>&reg;</sup> 3 I coauthored five puzzles: <a href="https://dcphr.org/2018/puzzles/snowballs.html">Snowball Toss</a>, <a href="https://dcphr.org/2018/puzzles/fairgrounds.html">Fairgrounds</a>, <a href="https://dcphr.org/2018/puzzles/magicians_assistant.html">Magicians Assistant</a>, <a href="https://dcphr.org/2018/puzzles/ferris_wheel.html">Ferris Wheel</a>, and <a href="https://dcphr.org/2018/puzzles/tunnel_of_love.html">Tunnel of Love</a>. For the opening mixer puzzle of this hunt I constructed a <a href="/writing/tips-for-painting-bras-in-thermochromatic-paint/#fn:1">balloon toss game using thermochromatic paint</a>.</p>

      <p>Aside from DCPH<sup>&reg;</sup>, I dabble with 3D printing and electronics to create puzzles. One example is my <a href="/writing/rainbow-box">Rainbow Box</a>; a 3D printed cube with buttons and a seven segment display. I have also been curating my own <a href="/puzzle-collection">puzzle collection</a>.</p>

      <p>At puzzle hunts I gravitate towards the puzzles which I can solve by writing a program. There is something exciting about encoding my knowledge of a problem as software and interactively using a computer to solve a puzzle. This can take many forms from a python script to grind through data, to a <a href="/files/advisors_nightmare.als">model using first-order logic with alloy</a>, to a <a href="/writing/solving-zebra-puzzles-with-minizinc/">natural language system attached to a SAT solver</a>.</p>
